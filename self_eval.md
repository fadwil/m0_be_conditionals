# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

- When you are trying to compare different conditions. They allow you to determine if a condition is met.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

- Not use git init within a child directory! Which is what I did when doing the code challenges. I need to slow down and look carefully at what is displayed on the terminal.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

- Well, I got myself into some trouble/confusion for a while as I stated in the previous answer. I ended up wasting some time and getting behind schedule because I didn't want to move on from this assignment until I had resolved the issue. I am just proud of myself for staying calm during the unknown.
